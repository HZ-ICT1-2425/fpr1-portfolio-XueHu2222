                            <h2>Why Choose ICT</h2>
                            <p class="is-size-5">My passion for ICT began with a hands-on project: building my first
                                computer. Putting together
                                individual components like the CPU, motherboard, and graphics card to create a fully
                                working system
                                required understanding the complex relationship between hardware and software, and this
                                process really
                                fascinated me. Solving problems when they came up and seeing the system run for the
                                first time gave me
                                an incredible sense of accomplishment. This feeling not only boosted my confidence but
                                also helped me
                                grow and improve my skills. Every success pushed me to take on new challenges. ICT gives
                                me constant
                                opportunities to challenge and improve myself, and because I enjoy overcoming
                                difficulties and the sense
                                of achievement, I believe ICT is the perfect field for me.</p>

                                <h2>Why am I suitable for ICT</h2>
                                <p class="is-size-5">Before coming here to study, I had no programming experience or
                                    foundation. These two images are my
                                    navigation bar code from the first day and fourth day of the PCO course. During
                                    these four days, I
                                    learned how to implement active, hover, and dropdown menu functions for the
                                    navigation bar. I believe I
                                    have the ability to quickly absorb new knowledge, which is why I think I am suitable
                                    for ICT.</p>

                                    beginning of the semester. By using websites like W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, and
                                    YouTube, I keep improving my coding skills. It feels like a level-up game, and it
                                    makes me very excited and enthusiastic to advance to the next level.</p>
